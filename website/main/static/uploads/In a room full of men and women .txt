In a room full of men and women 
Will I be the one your eyes look for,
Mine will be fixated on you 
but would yours be able to discern mine.
Would you look for just love 
and not time that they give,
for I do not sell myself to you
As you own me wholly 
I cannot give you what is mine
because I see you for what you are,
not what you have and all you have is time.
I do not need your promises 
for they are meant to be broken 
but will not you give me the reassurance 
that they will be granted unspoken.
I can never deny you the room 
but could you not deny me the pain
the room allows to seep in me.
We both know the truth 
It is not what it seems on
I am not choosing to be a passerby
I will never be one
So, give me the rosebud in your hand
and be merry with the people in room 
This chagrin of mine will not in any way stand
For I shall wait for it to bloom
